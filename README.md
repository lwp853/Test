# NR Rating Tool

This repository contains a Tkinter-based application for evaluating octave band sound pressure levels (SPL) against Noise Rating (NR) curves.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- matplotlib

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Running the Application

From the repository root, run:

```bash
python nr_tool.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to enter octave band SPLs for Low, Medium and High conditions, select NR curves to compare against and generate plots/results. Use the "Save Plot" button to export a PNG or PDF of the graph.
